    "COVID-19 is perhaps one of the most pervasive news topics these past few months. This new disease has dramatically impacted how society functions and can be felt by everyone. As a result, our group decided that we would try to help aid with sorting through the vast information (and misinformation) revolving around COVID-19. There have been a lot of projects done on mapping the spread of COVID-19 and extrapolating future infections based on that data. One notable example goes to John Hopkins CSSE department, who helped visualize the spread of COVID-19 across the world1. There has been a lot of talk about ‘social distancing’ to help lower the spread of coronavirus in the hopes that spreading out the cases will increase the ability for hospitals to treat patients effectively. This is extremely important, as this can be a deadly situation for patients without proper healthcare2. It is estimated that 20-60% of the population in the US will be infected by coronavirus by the time the disease has run its course2. It is painfully obvious that hospitals are ill prepared to deal with such drastic spikes in the number of patients. \n",
    "\tKnowing that, we were intrigued by the actual impact hospital size had on COVID-19 mortality rates. We want to hopefully draw out a clearer relationship between the number of hospital beds and the mortality rate in that area. The number of hospital beds correlates to the resources available to treat patients with COVID-19. The more resources available per patient, the more likely they are able to receive adequate treatment2. Helping determine the influences hospital sizes have on mortality rate, and possibly finding other factors that affect the efficacy of hospitals, can help people of interest triage their resources to minimize the negative effects of COVID-19.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there will be a negative correlation between the number of available hospital beds and the mortality rate for COVID-19 for each state. We predict that states with a higher proportion of elderly and higher population densities will have a higher mortality rate. We also predict that higher positive test percentages will lower the correlation between the number of available hospital beds and mortality rate. We are assuming that more hospital beds means better healthcare for the sick, which would lead to a lower mortality rate. However, a high proportion of elderly, a high population density, and a high positive test rate can lead to a high amount of COVID-19 cases that can overwhelm hospitals and therefore increase the mortality rate."

However, the data for the population size of a given city or state could be biased depending on how the data was retrieved from the source. For example, if the data was collected based on the number of people that own a phone, the percentage of the population without a phone will not be included in that number. Also, the number of infections in a certain area could also be biased as there will most likely be more people infected than the actual number that is gathered by the hospital or authorities.
